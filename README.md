- Data collection from Yahoo Finance and Binance API.
- Preprocessing and feature engineering (e.g., moving averages, RSI).
- Implementation of classical models (ARIMA, SARIMA) and machine learning models (LSTM, XGBoost).
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like RMSE and MAE.
- Simple web interface for visualization (Streamlit).
